            description: "<p>The International Space Station (ISS) is a <em>modular</em> space station (habitable artificial satellite) in low Earth orbit. It is a multinational collaborative project involving five participating space agencies: NASA (United States), Roscosmos (Russia), JAXA (Japan), ESA (Europe), and CSA (Canada). The ownership and use of the space station is established by intergovernmental treaties and agreements. The station serves as a microgravity and space environment research laboratory in which scientific research is conducted in astrobiology, astronomy, meteorology, physics, and other fields. The ISS is suited for testing the spacecraft systems and equipment required for possible future long-duration missions to the Moon and Mars.</p>",
            purpose: "The ISS is a microgravity and space environment research laboratory in which scientific research is conducted in many fields, including astrobiology, astronomy, meteorology, physics, and other fields. The station is suited for the testing of spacecraft systems and equipment required for missions to the Moon and Mars. The ISS maintains an orbit with an altitude of between 330 and 435 km (205 and 270 mi) by means of reboost manoeuvres using the engines of the Zvezda module or visiting spacecraft. It completes 15.54 orbits per day.",

            name: "Tiangong-2",
            description: "Tiangong-2 was a Chinese space laboratory and part of the Project 921-2 space station program. Tiangong-2 was launched on 15 September 2016. It was deorbited and burned up over the South Pacific on 19 July 2019.",
            purpose: "Tiangong-2 was a space laboratory with a short lifespan. It was designed to test key technologies that China will use in the construction of a permanent space station, such as life support systems, maintenance and refuelling, and recycling. It also carried out experiments in space medicine, space science, and space technology."
